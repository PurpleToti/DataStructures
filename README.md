# DataStructures
Implementation of data structures and their common algorithms.
The implementation will be in C, but the important things here are the concepts and
principle about those structures.

## Array
### Array
Basic array, just abstracts the malloc and free, fixed size of element and fixed size of memory
allocated.
### Dynamic array
A basic array that can ne grown keeping the data inside of it (it cannot be shrank!)
### Vector
TO IMPLEMENT /!\ An array that can be appened to and popped, can growand shrink depending on its actual
content
## Linked List
## Stack
## Queues
## Map
## HashTable
## Graph
## Tree

## Binary Search Tree
## Self Balancing Tree
